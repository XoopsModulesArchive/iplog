    <h4 class="odd">Description</h4>

    <p class="even">
        IP Log is a module to record either just Users or both Users and Anonymous guest IP Addresses.<br /><br />
    </p>
    <h4 class="odd">Install/uninstall</h4>

    No special measures necessary, follow the standard installation process - extract the /htdocs folder into the
    XOOPS ROOT Path. Install the module through Admin -> System Module -> Modules. If you need detailed
    instructions on how to install a module, please see the <a href="http://goo.gl/adT2i">XOOPS Operations
    Manual</a>.<br /><br />
    Make sure you install the IPInfoDB.com API Key in preferences otherwise the module will not function,
    correctly this is done by going to www.ipinfodb.com and signing up and once you have confirmed your 
    email address you will be provided with your API Key which you paste into the field for it in preferences.</p>
